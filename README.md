I'm just a guy who's an engineer for fun

### Introduction

Hi All,

I'm an engineer who loves to experiment and build cool things with technology, such as web, mobile, and desktop applications. 
I've created this Github account to sandbox and prototype ideas and concepts, (hopefully) build useful solutions, and learn how to become a better engineer through self study and practice.
I hope my projects can be helpful for you and that you enjoy using them!

Thanks,

G.B. Ferrum
